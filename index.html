<p><strong>"Hello World" Actuator for OpenC2 Messaging</strong></p>

<p>A stub server demontrating the content- and transport-agnostic OpenC2 Message interface.</p>

<p>A <em>message</em> is a logical unit consisting of domain-specific content plus an accompanying set of
domain-independent fields.  The purpose of this code is to show that a message is transferred
end-to-end without modification regardless of the transport protocol, while making use of the
message-related capabilities provided by each transport protocol.</p>

<p>Connect to the server from an OpenC2 message client at <a href='/api'>/api</a>.</p>
